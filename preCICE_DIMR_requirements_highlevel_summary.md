## Detailed Requirements Analysis

This document summarizes how preCICE performs against the DIMR replacement requirements. For each main requirement, sub-requirements (e.g. 1.a, 1.b, 1.c) are combined into a single summary, and the PoC team's responses are merged with an analysis based on preCICE technical documentation and our architectural evaluation.

## Requirement 1 – Easily configurable by the user

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Easily configurable by the user
- **Key aspects covered in sub-requirements:**
  - Configuration includes coupling type
  - Configuration includes data transferred between components
  - Component-centric configuration (kernel-specific)
  - Understandable configuration templates
  - Configuration includes execution type

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 2.40 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- The configuration file contains specifications of the coupling scheme (parallel vs serial and implicit vs explicit), and the library allows for an iterative approach when coupling multiple models in which some use an implicit scheme. 
- The configuration file specifies the name of the data, whether it is a scalar or a vector, the source and destination mesh names, and which components provide this data and these meshes.
- Component specific descriptions of the data to be exchanged are possible in the config files.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:

**Configuration System**:
- **XML-based configuration**: Comprehensive system supporting participants, coupling schemes (`serial-explicit`, `parallel-explicit`, `serial-implicit`, `parallel-implicit`), data exchange definitions, mapping configurations, and acceleration settings
- **Coupling schemes**: Support for explicit (single execution per time window) and implicit coupling (iterative until convergence) with configurable time windows (`time-window-size`, `max-time-windows`). Multi-coupling for more than two participants
- **Data exchange**: Detailed specification of data fields (scalar/vector), source/destination meshes, and participant mapping
- **XML validation**: Built-in file validation (not model) with detailed error reporting and configuration visualizer tools
- **Action configurations**: Modify coupling data at runtime, using built-in actions or python callback interface
- **Export configuration**: Monitor exchanged data by exporting it at every exchange window

**Time Management**:
- **Time window coordination**: Manages logical coupling time ensuring synchronized participant progression with `isCouplingOngoing()` API for simulation steering
- **Subcycling support**: Participants with smaller time steps automatically subcycle until coupling window reached
- **Convergence criteria**: Multiple convergence measures (`relative-convergence-measure`, `absolute-convergence-measure`, `absolute-or-relative-convergence-measure`) for implicit coupling
- **Acceleration schemes**: Constant under-relaxation, Aitken acceleration, and quasi-Newton methods (IQN-ILS/Anderson, IQN-IMVJ/Broyden) for stability and performance during parallel runs

**Parallel Computing Integration**:
- **MPI support**: Native integration with MPI-based solvers supporting domain decomposition and multi-rank data exchange
- **Communication backends**: TCP/IP sockets (robust, default) or MPI ports (10x performance improvement for large meshes)
- **Scalability**: Proven performance up to 10,000s of MPI ranks in production environments
- **Separate communicators**: Flexible execution with participants in separate MPI communicators for maximum solver independence

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.

## Requirement 2 – Standardized error log storage

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Standardized error log storage
- **Key aspects covered in sub-requirements:**
  - Error logs structured by component context
  - Error logs contain partition execution info
  - Decoupled logging implementation

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 0.75 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE partially meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- Error logging sinks can be specified in the config file. A component could integrate boost.log (the precice logging backend) in C++, but this is more invasive and not standard.
- Each component gets its own precice log and its native log. Logs are not structured outside of the folder based separation.
- Components are responsible for partitioning themselves, and they do not automatically integrate the precice logging framework.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:

**Logging Architecture and Capabilities**:
- **Configurable logging**: XML configuration supports `<log>` tags with `file`, `level` (trace, debug, info, warning, error), and `enabled` attributes for fine-grained control
- **Per-participant logs**: Each participant generates separate preCICE log files containing coupling events, iteration progress, convergence status, and performance metrics
- **Boost.Log backend**: C++ components can integrate preCICE's Boost.Log framework for unified logging, though this requires additional development effort
- **Structured event logging**: preCICE logs contain timestamped coupling events (time window progression, mapping execution, communication status, convergence measures)
- **Parallel execution context**: MPI rank information included in log messages for distributed debugging, though partition-specific aggregation requires external tooling
- **Export capabilities**: Convergence history and iteration residuals can be exported to files for post-processing analysis

**Limitations for Centralized Error Management**:
- **Decentralized by design**: Each participant maintains independent logs; no built-in cross-participant error correlation or centralized log aggregation
- **Component-specific logging**: Solver-specific errors (e.g., D-Flow FM internal errors) remain in native solver logs, separate from preCICE coupling logs
- **External integration required**: Centralized error management would require external orchestration tools or custom log aggregation systems

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE partially meets this requirement.

## Requirement 3 – Configurable output storage for component model outputs

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Configurable output storage for component model outputs

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 0.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE does not meet this requirement.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE is a library which handles mapping, communication, time stepping. It is called by the components. It is the component which is responsible for its output files.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE does not meet this requirement.

## Requirement 4 – Fixed priority for configuration sources

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Fixed priority for configuration sources

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 0.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE does not meet this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- There is only the config file which is the source of truth for preCICE coupling participants. It only caters to coupling configuration and not the solver's own configuration.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE uses an XML-based configuration file to define participants, meshes, data to be exchanged, mappings, and coupling schemes. This aligns well with requirements on explicit coupling configuration, but execution mode (e.g., serial vs. parallel launch of components) is managed outside preCICE by the user or orchestration scripts. Through proper library integration, preCICE is aware of the participant ranks.
- Fault recovery is limited: if a participant aborts or misbehaves, preCICE typically stops the coupling. There are no built-in fallback strategies (e.g., automatic restarts or degraded modes), so higher-level orchestration would be required to fully satisfy sophisticated recovery scenarios.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE does not meet this requirement.

## Requirement 5 – Pass parallel execution info to components

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Pass parallel execution info to components

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 0.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE does not meet this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- PreCICE does not control whether a component is performing parallel computations internally, it only controls whether the components are run in parallel or serial relative to each other.
- In a way this is good because components/solvers know best how to handle their partitioning and sharing of mesh data. They just keep preCICE informed using the api calls.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- **Business Impact**: preCICE focuses on coupling coordination rather than orchestration management [Config]. Each component manages its own parallel execution configuration independently.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE does not meet this requirement.

## Requirement 6 – Graceful handling of component-thrown errors

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Graceful handling of component-thrown errors

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 0.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE does not meet this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- PreCICE is unaware of errors from the components, and does not even terminate other components if one component hangs.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE itself focuses on logging coupling-related events (time window progression, communication, mapping, convergence), while each coupled solver keeps its own logs. It does not provide a centralized logging framework or structured error correlation across all components.
- Fault recovery is limited: if a participant aborts or misbehaves, preCICE typically stops the coupling. There are no built-in fallback strategies (e.g., automatic restarts or degraded modes), so higher-level orchestration would be required to fully satisfy sophisticated recovery scenarios.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE does not meet this requirement.

## Requirement 7 – Fallback logic on model errors

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Fallback logic on model errors
- **Key aspects covered in sub-requirements:**

- PreCICE plays no role here.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE itself focuses on logging coupling-related events (time window progression, communication, mapping, convergence), while each coupled solver keeps its own logs. It does not provide a centralized logging framework or structured error correlation across all components.
- Fault recovery is limited: if a participant aborts or misbehaves, preCICE typically stops the coupling. There are no built-in fallback strategies (e.g., automatic restarts or degraded modes), so higher-level orchestration would be required to fully satisfy sophisticated recovery scenarios.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE does not meet this requirement.

  - No hard-coded component paths required

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 0.67 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE partially meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- Each component should be started separately, PreCICE only handles the communication after it is started

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE uses an XML-based configuration file to define participants, meshes, data to be exchanged, mappings, and coupling schemes. This aligns well with requirements on explicit coupling configuration, but execution mode is managed outside preCICE by the user or orchestration scripts.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE partially meets this requirement.

## Requirement 9 – Knowledge of simulation time steps for all components

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Knowledge of simulation time steps for all components

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 2.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- preCICE tracks how much time progress is made by each component. It can either use its own time step or follow the time step of the first component.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE manages logical coupling time, ensuring that participants progress in a synchronized way. It supports explicit and implicit coupling schemes, fixed-point iterations, and can prevent time drift between solvers, which addresses many time-advancement-related requirements.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.

## Requirement 10 – Set simulation time steps for all components

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Set simulation time steps for all components

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 2.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- The computational timing still has to be set per component, using their own configuration. PreCICE only ensures that each component steps until a certain time (end of exchange time-window) so that data can be exchanged.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE manages logical coupling time, ensuring that participants progress in a synchronized way. It supports explicit and implicit coupling schemes, fixed-point iterations, and can prevent time drift between solvers, which addresses many time-advancement-related requirements.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.

## Requirement 11 – Control simulation advancement of components

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Control simulation advancement of components
- **Key aspects covered in sub-requirements:**
  - Schedule when data exchange occurs
  - Flexible time advancement per component
  - Parallel execution of components
  - Sequential execution of components
  - Asynchronous execution of components

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 2.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- One can use the preCICE max time window within the participants loops to calculate solver time steps such that an exchange can happen at end of preCICE time window.
- The config file specifies the run time and the time steps for the communication between components.
- Each component has its own time step and runs independent of the other components, preCICE only tells it the target time to reach, so the component will subcycle until the exchange time window is reached.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:

**Time Advancement and Execution Control**:
- **Coupling time windows**: XML configuration defines `time-window-size` and `max-time-windows` controlling synchronization points between participants
- **Flexible coupling schemes**: `serial-explicit` (sequential execution), `parallel-explicit` (simultaneous execution), and implicit variants with iterative coupling
- **Subcycling support**: Participants with smaller internal time steps automatically subcycle until coupling window target reached, enabling flexible time advancement per component
- **Synchronous coordination**: `advance()` API ensures participants progress in lockstep to coupling window boundaries, preventing time drift
- **Data exchange scheduling**: `exchange` tags in coupling schemes define when and what data is exchanged between specific participants
- **Asynchronous limitations**: preCICE enforces synchronous coupling boundaries; true asynchronous execution requires external orchestration beyond coupling windows

**Execution Flow Management**:
- **API-driven control**: Participants use `isCouplingOngoing()` to check continuation status and `advance()` to progress to next time window
- **Independent solver loops**: Each participant maintains its own computational loop and time stepping, with preCICE providing coordination points
- **MPI parallel execution**: Supports participants running in separate MPI communicators with rank-level parallelism within each participant

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.

## Requirement 12 – Schedule component initiation

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Schedule component initiation

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 1.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE partially meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- The components are responsible for running and initialization, then have to call preCICE API as well.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE uses an XML-based configuration file to define participants, meshes, data to be exchanged, mappings, and coupling schemes. This aligns well with requirements on explicit coupling configuration, but execution mode (e.g., serial vs. parallel launch of components) is managed outside preCICE by the user or orchestration scripts.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE partially meets this requirement.

## Requirement 13 – Schedule component execution

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Schedule component execution

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 2.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- The components are told to increment a certain step, but are responsible for telling preCICE how far they have incremented.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE uses an XML-based configuration file to define participants, meshes, data to be exchanged, mappings, and coupling schemes. This aligns well with requirements on explicit coupling configuration, but execution mode (e.g., serial vs. parallel launch of components) is managed outside preCICE by the user or orchestration scripts.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.

## Requirement 14 – Schedule component teardown

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Schedule component teardown

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 2.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- The components are told to stop at the end, but the components should be configured to not stop by themselves. If one of the component stops before the configured end-time of coupling in preCICE, preCICE will throw an error.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE uses an XML-based configuration file to define participants, meshes, data to be exchanged, mappings, and coupling schemes. This aligns well with requirements on explicit coupling configuration, but execution mode (e.g., serial vs. parallel launch of components) is managed outside preCICE by the user or orchestration scripts.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.

## Requirement 15 – Manage available resource usage based on scheduling

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Manage available resource usage based on scheduling

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 2.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments are:
- PreCICE does not do this, but OS can control the executables better now and preCICE optimizes which ones can run in parallel, since if a component waits for another, preCICE lets the OS be aware of it.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- For this requirement, preCICE does not directly implement orchestration-level features, but can be a building block when combined with external scripts, workflow tools, or a dedicated orchestrator.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.

## Requirement 16 – Enforce data ownership boundaries

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Enforce data ownership boundaries
- **Key aspects covered in sub-requirements:**
  - Prevent direct write access between components

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 2.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments were:
- The config file defines which data should be exchanged, but communication happens over the network and keeps components separated.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:

**Data Ownership and Access Control**:
- **Network-based isolation**: Communication occurs over TCP/IP sockets or MPI ports, maintaining complete process separation between participants
- **XML-defined data exchange**: Explicit configuration of data fields, source/destination participants, and mesh associations prevents unauthorized access
- **Directional data flow**: `write-data` and `read-data` tags strictly define data ownership and access permissions per participant
- **Mesh ownership**: `provide-mesh` and `receive-mesh` configurations establish clear geometric data ownership boundaries
- **No direct memory access**: Participants cannot directly access each other's data structures or memory space, all exchange goes through preCICE API
- **Controlled data modification**: Only designated participants can write specific data fields, with acceleration algorithms modifying data only during coupling iterations

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.”

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- preCICE manages logical coupling time, ensuring that participants progress in a synchronized way. It supports explicit and implicit coupling schemes, fixed-point iterations, and can prevent time drift between solvers, which addresses many time-advancement-related requirements.

Representative PoC comments were:
- Communication is standardised through the library. Components need to implement the API calls and can use available bindings.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- For this requirement, preCICE is unaware of the component. It is the component which needs to make relevant API calls to preCICE to let it manage remapping, time-stepping, time interpolation, etc.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE meets this requirement.

## Requirement 18 – Execute any single component individually

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Execute any single component individually

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 1.00 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE partially meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments were:
- Each component is fully responsible for running, so they can be run independently, but they are also not controlled by preCICE.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- For this requirement, preCICE needs to be implemented in a way that the calls in the component are suppressed when coupling isn't required. 

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE partially meets this requirement.

## Requirement 19 – Monitor performance metrics during component runs

### Combined Requirement Summary

- **Main requirement:** Monitor performance metrics during component runs

### Combined preCICE Evaluation (PoC + Technical Analysis)

During the PoC, the team assigned this requirement an **average score of 1.33 on the 0–3 scale**, which implies that preCICE partially meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments were:
- PreCICE contains a built-in profiler that tracks the time spent during events with an additional python tool that can transform this data between different representations and merge the data of different component runs.
- Time is tracked, memory usage is not tracked.
Since executables are seprate, we can use tools in the OS to track.
- preCICE is not responsible for memory management or error propagation and plays no role here.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:
- While preCICE introduces relatively low overhead in most scenarios, it does not include a full performance monitoring stack. Performance analysis is typically done using external profilers and logging around the solvers and preCICE calls.

### Overall Assessment

- **Summary:** preCICE partially meets this requirement.

Representative PoC comments were:
- The library is meant for high performance computing. However, it fully depends on the implementation and the specific models being coupled.
- In our test cases, we did not see a decrease in performance, albeit, we saw MPI cases were faster with preCICE.
- In prelimnary runs where all data in FM-Wave coupling is via preCICE< it is about 1-2 % improvement.

From a technical perspective, considering preCICE's architecture and features:

- **Dual API Maintenance**: Teams would need to maintain both BMI and preCICE APIs simultaneously
- **Performance Overhead**: Adapter layer introduces unnecessary translation and potential bottlenecks
- **Grid Connectivity Complexity**: Advanced preCICE features would require custom implementation within adapter
- **Control Limitations**: Adapter-as-executable model conflicts with kernel control requirements

**�🛠 Recommended Strategy:**

Based on the existing proof-of-concept implementation, the optimal path forward is **direct preCICE integration within the Delft3D kernels**:

- **Leverages Existing Work**: Build upon the proven PoC implementation already integrated in `wave_main.F90` and `unstruc_api.F90`
- **Optimal Performance**: Direct integration eliminates adapter overhead and API translation layers
- **Full Control**: Kernels maintain responsibility for executables, MPI processes, and time management under Deltares control
- **Proven Architecture**: Current implementation demonstrates successful coupling between D-Wave and D-Flow FM

**🏗 Current Implementation Foundation:**

The existing PoC already includes functional preCICE integration:

- **D-Wave Integration** (`wave_main.F90`):
  - `initialize_fm_coupling()`: Creates preCICE participant, registers wave mesh, initializes coupling
  - `is_fm_coupling_ongoing()`: Checks coupling status during simulation
  - `advance_fm_time_window()`: Manages preCICE time advancement and data exchange

- **D-Flow FM Integration** (`unstruc_api.F90`):
  - `initialize_precice_coupling()`: Handles both serial and parallel (MPI) initialization
  - `register_flow_nodes_with_precice()`: Registers flow mesh with preCICE
  - `advance_precice_time_window()`: Writes bed levels and advances coupling

- **Data Exchange**: Bidirectional exchange of bed levels, water levels, and flow velocities
- **MPI Support**: Proper handling of parallel execution with communicator management
- **Fortran Interface**: Direct use of `precice.F90` bindings for optimal performance

### Risk Mitigation

**🛡 Addressing Key Concerns:**

1. **Orchestration Gap**: Deploy complementary workflow management tools (e.g., SLURM, container orchestration)
2. **Platform Support**: Containerization strategy ensures consistent deployment across environments  
3. **Learning Curve**: Existing PoC provides foundation for team knowledge transfer and training
4. **Integration Complexity**: Direct kernel integration avoids API translation issues and maintains full control

### Return on Investment
