# Compiling Delft3D

## Windows
- build.bat from an Intel oneAPI command prompt for Intel 64 for Visual Studio 2022.
  Execute "build.bat -help" to show the usage.
- Open the generated solution from the command prompt to ensure that the intel environment is inherited by visual studio. For example:
  "devenv build_fm-suite\fm-suite.sln"
- Build from visual studio, or alternatively, use the command line to run
  "cmake --build build_fm-suite --config Debug"
  "cmake --install build_fm-suite --config Debug"

## Linux
- build.sh
  Execute "./build.sh --help" to show the usage
  Currently used as default build process: "./build.sh fm-suite --compiler intel21"
  This will execute "src/setenv.sh" on Deltares systems. On other systems, the environment must be prepared upfront.
  For instructions, see [Setup your own Linux environment](Linux_setup.md).

#### Alternative: without build-script (Windows and Linux)
See ...\src\cmake\README
WARNING: When building without build-script, the collection of the resulting binaries will need attention

# Debugging DIMR in VisualStudio
Note: in this section:
Replace "..." by the actual path on your system to the checkout directory.

- Use build.bat to prepare the "fm-suite" configuration
- Open "...\build_fm-suite\fm-suite.sln" in VisualStudio and build the complete release version
  Directory "...\build_fm-suite\x64\Release\share\bin" will be created
- Build the debug versie of what you need (e.g. dimr and dflowfm, waq, wave)
- dimr project -> Set as Startup Project
- dimr project -> properties -> Debugging:
    -> Command Arguments: dimr_config.xml
    -> Working Directory: ...\examples\12_dflowfm\test_data\e100_f02_c02-FriesianInlet_schematic_FM
    -> Environment: PATH=...\build_fm-suite\x64\Debug;%PATH%;...\fm-suite\x64\Release\share\bin

# Unit tests
## Running Unit tests
After building the source code, you can run the unit tests with `ctest`. 
You can do this by running `ctest` in the build directory. Be sure to pass the "config"
(`Debug`/`Release`) with the `-C|--build-config` argument.
```
cd build_fm-suite
ctest --build-config Debug
```

Or...

`ctest --test-dir build_fm-suite --build-config Debug`

`ctest` allows you to customize which tests you want to run or exclude, and supports
options for customizing the output. For instance, you can use the `--output-junit` option
to write the test results to an XML file, which is recognized by many tools that process
test results. Use `ctest --help` for an overview of the options.

For more details about the unit testing utilities in cmake, see [Fortran Unit Testing](doc/unit-testing.md).
